### Pre environment
1. **Node**: Check that both your development environment and deployment environment are using `Node v18` or later. You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage multiple `node` versions locally。
   ```bash
    node -v
   ```
2. **PNPM**: We recommend using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) to manage dependencies. If you have never installed pnpm, you can install it with the following command:
   ```bash
    npm i -g pnpm
   ```
3. **OPENAI_API_KEY**: Before running this application, you need to obtain the API key from OpenAI. You can register the API key at [https://beta.openai.com/signup](https://beta.openai.com/signup).
